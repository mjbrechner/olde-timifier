            <div>The Olde-Timifier is a tool to convert modern English text to appear as it was written in an earlier
                period of the history of the language, switching out contemporary orthographic practices for those of
                olden times. It does not aim to exactly replicate any one particular moment in history, but rather
                strives to evoke a quasi-historical feel through the use of the <i>thorn</i> (Þ, þ), which replaces a <i>th</i>,
                and the <i>long s</i> (ſ), which sometimes replaces a <i>lowercase s</i>.
                Both letters have a long history of use. Much of this history overlapped, although the conventions of
                usage, particularly with the intricate practices surrounding the <i>long s</i>, changed over the years.
                The Olde-Timifier can mimic some of the antiquated orthographic practices using these letters, though
                otherwise, the grammar, spelling, and overall style will otherwise remain as it was originally entered.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="info-area">
            <div>The Olde-Timifier employs two archaic letters from the history of the English language, the
                <i>thorn</i>
                and the <i>long s</i>.</div>
            <div>THORN (Þ, þ) &mdash; This letter appeared in Old English along with the letter <i>eth</i> (Ð, ð) to
                represent
                both voiced and voiceless dental fricatives.
                Both of these sounds are represented in Modern English by the digraph <i>th</i>. While the <i>eth</i>
                gradually fell out of use in English,
                the <i>thorn</i> was frequently used during the Middle English period and continued into the Early
                Modern English era.</div>
            <div>
                With the arrival of movable type printing, the letter <i>y</i> began replacing the <i>thorn</i>, as
                movable types were imported from areas in which the <i>thorn</i> was not used. This substitution
                resulted in the word <i>ye</i> frequently replacing <i>þe</i> (i.e. <i>the</i>), which is popularly
                parodied in modern times in the phrase <q>ye olde,</q> which, of course would have been pronounced in
                earlier times as <q>the</q>, quite unlike the <i>y</i> sound in the second-person plural pronoun
                <q>ye</q>.
            </div>
            <div>In the Olde-Timifier, the <i>th</i> digraph can be replaced with a lowercase <i>þ</i>, with an
                uppercase <i>Þ</i> replacing a capitalized <i>Th</i> or <i>TH</i>.
            </div>
            <div>
                LONG S (ſ) &mdash; The <i>long s</i> is an archaic form of the lowercase <i>s</i> that was used in
                various ways
                starting in the medieval period when uppercase and lowercase letters became prevalent. Eventually,
                various conventions became established that dictated in which situations to choose either <i>ſ</i> and
                <i>s</i>. The Olde-Timifier uses the following conventions:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>A short <i>s</i> is applied at the end of each word.</li>
                <li>Before an apostrophe, a short <i>s</i> is used.</li>
                <li> In the case of the letter being doubled, the first instance is long and the second short, appearing
                    as
                    <i>ſs</i>.</li>
                <li>Before and after the letter <i>f</i>, a short <i>s</i> is used, as seen in <i>fs</i> or <i>sf</i>.
                </li>
                <li>In other instances, a long <i>ſ</i> is used, except when an uppercase letter is required, in which
                    case <i>S</i> remains the standard.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>The rules regarding the use of the <i>long s</i> changed over time, and it eventually fell out of favor
                with printers in the early 19th century, persisting a little longer in handwriting. It can sometimes be
                found in modern times, as a character in the International Phonetic Alphabet or as a symbol used in
                calculus.</div>
